This example demonstrates using a single color for all particles. The coral red color gives the text a unified, cohesive appearance. All particles are the same color, creating a clean and professional look.

## Live Demo

<CanvasExample
  title="Single Color"
  config={{
    text: 'SINGLE COLOR',
    colors: ['#FF6B6B'],
    fontSize: 100
  }}
  height={400}
  showStats={false}
/>

## Configuration

<CodePreview
  code={`initParticleJS('#canvas', {
  text: 'SINGLE COLOR',
  colors: ['#FF6B6B'],  // Single color in array
  fontSize: 100
});`}
  language="javascript"
/>

## Key Features

- **Unified Appearance:** All particles share the same vibrant coral red color (#FF6B6B)
- **Clean Aesthetic:** Single color creates a professional, cohesive look
- **High Contrast:** Coral red stands out beautifully on dark backgrounds
- **Array Format:** Even single colors must be provided in array format for consistency

## Important Note

Even when using a single color, you still need to provide it as an array: `['#FF6B6B']`. This maintains consistency with the multi-color configuration format. The color format must be a 6-digit hexadecimal color code (#RRGGBB).

## Use Cases

Single color configurations work well for:
- Brand-specific particle effects matching your company colors
- Minimalist designs requiring a clean, unified look
- Situations where you want to emphasize one specific color
- Professional or corporate websites
