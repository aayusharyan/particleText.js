description: Create vibrant, rainbow-like effects with randomly distributed particle colors

<!-- TODO: Update this documentation to demonstrate the new color weight system -->
<!-- New format: colors: [{ color: '#FF6B6B', weight: 3 }, { color: '#4ECDC4', weight: 1 }] -->
<!-- Higher weights = more particles with that color for controlled distribution -->

import CodePreview from '../../../../components/CodePreview.astro';

This example demonstrates the multi-color feature where each particle is randomly assigned one of the specified colors. This creates a vibrant, rainbow-like effect that makes the text more dynamic and eye-catching.

## Live Demo

<CanvasExample
  title="Multiple Colors"
  config={{
    text: 'RAINBOW TEXT',
    colors: ['#FF6B6B', '#4ECDC4', '#45B7D1', '#FFA07A', '#98D8C8'],
    fontSize: 100
  }}
  height={400}
  showStats={false}
/>

## Configuration

<CodePreview
  code={`initParticleJS('#canvas', {
  text: 'RAINBOW TEXT',
  colors: [
    '#FF6B6B',  // Coral Red
    '#4ECDC4',  // Turquoise
    '#45B7D1',  // Sky Blue
    '#FFA07A',  // Light Salmon
    '#98D8C8'   // Mint Green
  ],
  fontSize: 100
});`}
  language="javascript"
/>

## Key Features

- **Random Distribution:** Each particle gets a random color from your palette
- **Vibrant Effect:** Creates dynamic, colorful text that stands out
- **Flexible Palette:** Use 2-10 colors based on your design needs
- **Visual Interest:** Multi-color particles add energy and personality

## How It Works

When multiple colors are provided, each particle is assigned a random color from the array during initialization. The color distribution is random, so you'll see a nice mix of all colors throughout the text. Each time the page loads, particles get randomly distributed colors from the palette.

## Best Practices

- **Color Count:** Use 3-5 colors for best visual effect
- **Too Many Colors:** More than 7-8 colors can look chaotic
- **Too Few Colors:** Just 2 colors might not create enough variety
- **Color Harmony:** Choose colors that complement each other for a professional appearance
- **Contrast:** Ensure all colors have good contrast against your background

## Use Cases

Multi-color configurations are perfect for:
- Creative portfolios and artistic websites
- Entertainment and gaming sites
- Children's applications
- Festive or celebratory themes
- Bold, attention-grabbing hero sections
