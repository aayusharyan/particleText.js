description: The most commonly used size for headers and titles with balanced particle density

import CanvasExample from '../../../../components/CanvasExample.astro';
import CodePreview from '../../../../components/CodePreview.astro';

This example shows the most commonly used size - medium text (100px) with standard particle density. This is ideal for headers, titles, and main text elements that need to be clearly readable while maintaining the beautiful particle effect.

## Live Demo

<CanvasExample
  title="Medium Text"
  config={{
    text: 'MEDIUM',
    fontSize: 100,
    particleRadius: { 'xs': { base: 1, rand: 1 } },
    colors: ['#FF6B6B', '#4ECDC4', '#45B7D1']
  }}
  height={300}
  showStats={false}
/>

## Configuration

<CodePreview
  code={`initParticleJS('#canvas', {
  text: 'MEDIUM',
  fontSize: 100,
  particleRadius: {
    'xs': { base: 1, rand: 1 }  // Standard particles (1-2px)
  },
  colors: ['#FF6B6B', '#4ECDC4', '#45B7D1']
});`}
  language="javascript"
/>

## Key Features

- **Balanced Sizing:** 100px font size is readable on most screens
- **Standard Particles:** 1-2px particles provide good detail without lag
- **Optimal Performance:** Sweet spot between visual quality and performance
- **Versatile:** Works well in most design contexts

## Best Practices

- **Font Size Range:** 80-120px is the recommended range for medium text
- **Particle Density:** 1-2px particles provide good detail without lag
- **Canvas Dimensions:** Keep width under 1500px for good performance
- **Color Count:** 2-4 colors work well at this size
- **Readable:** Text remains clearly legible

## Use Cases

Medium text configurations are perfect for:
- Page headers and titles
- Section headings
- Call-to-action text
- Landing page headlines
- Hero section text
- Main content headings

## Performance Considerations

Medium text offers balanced performance:
- Moderate particle count (1000-2000 particles typically)
- Smooth on most modern devices
- Good for desktop and tablet displays
- May need optimization for older mobile devices
